<p>I work to integrate neuroscience, medicine, computer science and public policy. 

<p>Periodically, I write stuff: <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog">blog</a></p>

<p>Feel free to reach out for <strong>mentorship/advice, especially BIPOC and LGBTQ+ individuals</strong>. I recognize I am still training myself, but I want to support those in earlier stages and/or considering these paths. I'll do my best to respond as soon as possible.</p>
